      <description>I believe learning these before getting into coding will help beginners tremendously. The more backstory they know, the better, because they tend to have these unanswered questions in their mind and they either don&amp;rsquo;t ask them or they get buried with some answer they came up with on their own to them. I call these gaps of knowledge that eventually get filled in time piece by piece, but ideally some of them should be learned at the foundation level.</description>
