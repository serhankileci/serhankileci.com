writing what your soul wants you to

write because you have something you urgently and desperately want to say, and the rest will come; you will go out there and get it, and you won’t take no for an answer until you do. this goes for any art form. we all have our poison in that regard. if writing is how you best channel your demons or your angels, you will know it. if you have something you desperately want to say, no excuse will be able to stop you. similarly, Ernest Hemingway said; “write the truest sentence you know”

write what you know, or know how to research what; and research that well

when Tom Waits was asked how he got his unique, gravely voice, he said “I guess you get the voice you deserve”. waits is a mystic, so this has layers of meanings. at face value it means that Tom was born with this voice, but he also means that he developed this voice as one “deserves” it through hardwork. you work to find your voice, but you are also born with a part of your voice, so to speak. when we grow up we already a voice

consume a variety of many stories. Geddy Lee of Rush said it best; “originality is when you have so many influences that you can’t tell which — you can’t tell them anymore”

as a writer, you’re trying to convince the reader with imaginary scenarios, of things in real life that real life couldn’t convince them of. it’s a difficult task (paraphrase this)

the reader doesn’t know what they think they want. they think they don’t want what they don’t know of

inspiration comes in many forms, draw it from other mediums. you’ll be surprised how stories you deem irrelevant to the content you aim to create will inspire you by putting you in the right mood

---

be ready for inspiration to strike at any given moment and to write it down, be it nighttime or a single sentence. once you forget it, you will never quite recover that content back. Jimi Hendrix cooked his breakfast with a guitar on his back in case of inspiration

good work is not good because it’s hard to understand. someone who doesn’t know anything about literature should be able to appreciate your work even if they don’t understand why they do or the technical and emotional complexity of it

words always mean more than we think they do, and there are many ways to construct the same sentence; they might all get the same idea across but will affect the mood differently. subtle ways you use words add depth to your writing; a character describing an unwelcome idea that they have in their head could sound more convincing if they use “that idea” instead of “this/the idea”, i.e. “I loathed that very idea”; the word “that” here puts distance between the character and the idea that they dislike, hence, “that” (over there, far away) instead of “this” (over here, close proximity)
