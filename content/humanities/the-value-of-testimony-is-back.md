While testimony is already valued since people can slander and there will be the connotation of that slander lingering etcout there in the world with new people.

Very soon, we're going to have come to terms with not knowing whether what we see and hear are real.
In such a short time we went from not being able to prove sight and hearing and relying on word of mouth and in testimony, and having faith in the written word, to seeing and hearing things without really seeing and hearing them with our eyes and ears through cameras and microphones, and finally back to such technological advancement that weâ€™re nearing an era where we will no longer be able to fully tell whether what weâ€™re seeing and hearing through technology is real, and go back to our usual ways before technology.
