So many books, poems, scientific facts, historical quotes, and even words spoken to one another have been and are vastly misinterpreted because they are not crystal clear, and even if there is a deeper meaning, it is not explained anywhere else by its originator. This phenomena, naturally throughout history, birthed concepts like the Death of the Author, etc.

No, we are not talking about words lost in translation, or words deliberately constructed in puzzling ways, but clear-cut words both written and spoken, that result in further questions because the main message was not enough.

And education, articulation, or linguistics knowledge doesn‚Äôt seem to render one immune to this phenomenon either. Often times, we know the context of what we are attempting to communicate, but do not know just how much context the recipient is aware of, and the level to that we assume changes the way we communicate an idea.

literature is specifically guilty of this and rather deliberately; we‚Äôd rather be vague and let our words have layers of meaning ‚Äî some of which we never even intended them to ‚Äî than let the reader know exactly what we mean. we seek an adventureous pairing of words over a shorter and clearer sentence

the most pressing area of the subject of this great barrier of communication is real life conversations. we say things we don‚Äôt intend to because we lack the words, or we forget that the listener lacks the context and is not on the same page as us, etc.

it's not enough that one might walk on eggshells not to relate one's own thoughts to what one thinks can be perceived
as hostile, rather the burden must be on the listener not to analyze what was not said.
