One‚Äôs self is manyfold; he who observes, thinks, and speaks inward ‚Äî and he who passively listens to the other, and reacts. He whose personality varies based on his externals, he whose mind contradicts himself because his heart has a mind of its own.

<br />

Write down any thoughts during the day that particularly strike you. These thoughts can be of any variety, as long as they seem important to you, or if they are not important but regularly cross your mind, you should still note them down.

<br />

Over time, try to spot thought patterns in them

<br />

Categorize them by regular and irregular thoughts

<br />

Regular thoughts are the ones you should heed, and further examine, in order to shape your lifestyle around them

<br />

Irregular thoughts are the ones you should fear, because they‚Äôre irregularly coming up in your head for a reason

<br />

Also write down any thoughts that haunt you at night as you‚Äôre trying to sleep, or specific dreams.

<br />

The reasons why are many:

- Because these thoughts burden you, and at the very least you should be aware of what they are even if you‚Äôre not actively solving them. These thoughts can include any kind of thought, judgement, etc. you know about yourself already or are yet to discover through pattern recognition by writing down your recurring thoughts. Any kind of thought or idea that can help you solidify your own self, your character, your dreams, your likes and fears, your principles, etc. You must not omit any eerie, otherwise shameful or dreadful thoughts from your notes.
- I often go to bed in a hopeful state, with the mindset of tomorrow is a new day, and that I am alright, with strong convictions and feelings, but just as often wake up having lost all that clarity and more. Hence, you must document your thoughts, such as any hopeful idea you have, what you love in life, what you live for, what you strive to do, the feelings you are unapologetic about, etc. The reset we get after a night‚Äôs sleep can be useful to escape demons, but it can also reverse any progress we might have made the night before, which in turn will only strengthen the demons we aspired to escape.

<br />

The key is to be consistent so that it shapes into an object that you can deconstruct, and to be punctual so that you don‚Äôt forget a thought passing you by during the day.
Write down ur dreams and in the morning read them, constantly be aware of them, so that you dont feel dazed and confused on a new day

<br />

Write down any idea or recurrence that is special to you. As we grow, we notice more and more new things about ourselves that we have been doing forever.

<br />

You need to solidify your principles. Write down what you think is right, about everything. We all have convictions, and it‚Äôs best that we‚Äôre fully aware of them. Being aware of these ideas will only help you put the rest of the puzzle pieces together.
